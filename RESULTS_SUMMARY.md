## üéì Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **SMOTE Balancing**: Dramatically improved minority class detection
2. **Feature Engineering**: One-hot encoding captured categorical patterns
3. **Multiple Models**: Different strengths for different use cases
4. **Explainability**: SHAP provided actionable insights
5. **Config-Driven**: Easy to experiment and tune

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Default params used (room for optimization)
2. **Feature Selection**: All 30 features used (could reduce)
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Individual models only (stacking could help)
4. **Temporal Features**: No time-series patterns captured
5. **Customer Interactions**: Transaction history not included

### Next Steps

1. **Tune XGBoost** - Grid search for optimal hyperparameters
2. **Feature Selection** - Reduce to top 15-20 most important
3. **Ensemble Model** - Stack all 3 models for better predictions
4. **A/B Testing** - Deploy and measure real-world impact
5. **Monitor Performance** - Track accuracy over time
6. **Expand Features** - Add usage patterns, support tickets
7. **Survival Analysis** - Predict time-to-churn
8. **Customer Segments** - Separate models for different segments
